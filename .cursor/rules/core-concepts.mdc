# Core concepts

## The projects folder contains a front-end application written in Angular:

- The main goal is to quote custom frames for artists and galleries
- Focus on speed and ease of use

## Core aspects:

- Use of es-form-system
- A custom backend in workspace folder named `cadrart2025-backend`
- Signal-Based Reactivity
- Type safe everything
- Composition over inheritance
- Any text displayed in templates should come from translation files

### Application Development

- During development, `cadrart2025-common`and `es-fs-form` are built, published and installed from regitry. `cadrart2025-backend` nad `cadrart2025-frontent` however need to run in watch mode
- Use `npm run build` for production builds
- Use `npm start` for development with file watching
- Workspace project `cadrart2025-backend` needs to run before starting frontend.
